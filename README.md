# **ML-Diabetes-Project in Python**
## **Overview**
This project is a collaboration between [@DrorArbiv](https://github.com/DrorArbiv) and [@Eynat_Sela](https://github.com/Eynat_Sela).

This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting diabetes based on health indicators. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various health-related features along with information on whether an individual has diabetes or not.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset obtained from Kaggle. It includes a variety of health indicators such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset).
